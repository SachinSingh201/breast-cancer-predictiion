# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

## Objective: 
The objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model capable of predicting the presence of cancer in patients based on a comprehensive set of medical attributes and diagnostic data. The model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and diagnosis of cancer, thereby enhancing patient outcomes through timely and targeted interventions. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques and a diverse dataset, this project seeks to provide a valuable tool that can integrate seamlessly into clinical workflows, support decision-making processes, and ultimately contribute to improved patient care and survival rates.
